# 0x15. API

All along, we have been writing shell scripts for cross-platform communication. In this project, I am introduced to <b>Application Programming Interfaces</b> which is simply a <i>software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other though defined interfaces.</i>

Concepts learnt:
- What Bash scripting should not be used for
- What is an API
- What is a REST API
- What are microservices
- What is the CSV format
- What is the JSON format
- Pythonic Package and module name style
- Pythonic Class name style
- Pythonic Variable name style
- Pythonic Function name style
- Pythonic Constant name style
- Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python
