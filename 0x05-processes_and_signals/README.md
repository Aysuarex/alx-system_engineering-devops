# Processes and signals

In this project, I learned about handling process ID's and signals in Bash
with `ps`, `pgrep`, `pkill`, `pkill`, `exit`, and `trap`.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. What is my PID**
  * [0-what-is-my-pid](./0-what-is-my-pid): Bash script that displays its own PID.

* **1. List your processes**
  * [1-list_your_processes](./1-list_your_processes): Bash script that displays a
  list of currently running processes.
  * Shows all processes for all users, including those not featuring a TTY.
  * Processes are displayed in a user-oriented hierarchy.

* **2. Show your Bash PID**
  * [2-show_your_bash_pid](./2-show_your_bash_pid): Bash script that displays lines
  containing the `bash` keyword based on the script defined in `1-list_your_processes`.

* **3. Show your Bash PID made easy**
  * [3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy](./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy): Bash script
  that displays the PID along with the process name of processes who name contains the
  word `bash`.

* **4. To infinity and beyond**
  * [4-to_infinity_and_beyond](./4-to_infinity_and_beyond): Bash script that displays
  `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely with a `sleep 2` in between each iteration.

* **5. Don't stop me now!**
  * [5-dont_stop_me_now](./5-dont_stop_me_now): Bash script that kills the
  [4-to_infinity_and_beyond](./4-to_infinity_and_beyond) process using `kill`.

* **6. Stop me if you can**
  * [6-stop_me_if_you_can](./6-stop_me_if_you_can): Bash script that kills the
  [4-to_infinity_and_beyond](./4-to_infinity_and_beyond) process using `pkill`.

* **7. Highlander**
  * [7-highlander](./7-highlander): Bash script that displays `To infinity and beyond`
  indefinitely with a `sleep 2` in between each iteration.
  * Displays `I am invincible!!!` upon receiving a `SIGTERM` signal.

* **8. Beheaded process**
  * [8-beheaded_process](./8-beheaded_process): Bash script that kills the process
  [7-highlander](./7-highlander).

* **9. Process and PID file**
  * [100-process_and_pid_file](./100-process_and_pid_file): Bash script that creates the file
  `/var/run/holbertonscript.pid` containing its PID and displays `To infinity and
  beyond` indefinitely.
  * Displays `I hate the kill command` upon receiving a `SIGTERM` signal.
  * Displays `Y U no love me?!` upon receiving a `SIGINT` signal.
  * Deletes the file `/var/run/holbertonscript.pid` and terminates itself
  upon receiving the `SIGQUIT` or `SIGTERM` signal.

* **10. Manage my process**
  * [manage_my_process](./manage_my_process): Bash script that writes `I am alive!` to the file
  `/tmp/my_process` indefinitely.
    * Sleeps two seconds in between each write.
  * [101-manage_my_process](./101-manage_my_process): Bash script that manages the
  [manage_my_process](./manage_my_process) script.
  * When passed the argument `start`:
    * Starts [manage_my_process](./manage_my_process).
    * Creates a file containing its PID in `/var/run/my_process.pid`.
    * Displays `manage_my_process started`.
  * When passed the argument `stop`:
    * Stops [manage_my_process](./manage_my_process).
    * Deletes the file `/var/run/my_process.pid`.
    * Displays `manage_my_process stopped`.
  * When passed the argument `restart`:
    * Stops [manage_my_process](./manage_my_process).
    * Deletes the file `/var/run/my_process.pid`.
    * Starts `manage_my_process`.
    * Creates a file containing its PID in `/var/run/my_process.pid`.
    * Displays `manage_my_process started`.
  * Otherwise, displays `Usage: manage_my_process {start|stop|restart}`.

* **11. Zombie**
  * [102-zombie.c](./102-zombie.c): C program that creates five zombie processes.
  * For every zombie created, displays `Zombie process created, PID:
  <ZOMBIE_PID>`.
